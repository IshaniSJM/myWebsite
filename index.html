        <p>
            When I was young, every summer I played games on a old laptop which my father gave me. All I did was stare at that 
            screen playing game every day and week. But I also wondered how it worked. How can a few words create something 
            this complex? I thought to myself. And thats when I got interest in software development.

        <div> <img src = "" alt = "" id = "VisionAndGoals"> </div>
        <p>
            I want more people to feel what I felt when I was playing games. I want more people to understand the 
            facinating possibilities of digital language and get interested in this like how I did.
